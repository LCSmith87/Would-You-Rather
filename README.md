### Project Rubric

#### Application Setup

- [x] Requires only `npm install` and `npm start` to get installed and launched
- [x] An updated README that describes the project and has instructions for installing and launching

#### Login Flow

- [x] There should be a way for the user to impersonate/ log in as an existing user. (This could be as simple as having a login box that appears at the root of the application. The user could then select a name from the list of existing users.)
- [x] The application works correctly regardless of which user is selected.
- [x] The application allows the user to log out and log back in. The user should be logged in to submit new polling questions, vote, and view the leaderboard.
- [x] Once the user logs in, the home page is shown.
- [x] Whenever the user types something in the address bar, the user is asked to log in before the requested page is shown.
